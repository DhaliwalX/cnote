# cnote
Take notes from command line. `cnote` is a simple app that can instantly save your notes. You can make your notes in your favorite text
editor (Just define $EDITOR environment variable).

## Building
Simple ;). Use `cmake` to build the project.

## Start taking note
CAUTION: Currently only one note can be stored in ~/cnote.temp. I am currently working on this project. So wait till all the features
are added.

## TODO

- [x] Project started
- [x] Start taking note
- [x] Save atleast one note
- [ ]  Save notes in the json format.

This list is still incomplete! Help me in completing it.
